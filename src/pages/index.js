        Those first days, sorrow's pain
        <br />
        was tangible:
        <br />
        an amputation, a dismemberment,
        <br />
        the gap so great, no sobs,
        <br />
        children, friends
        <br />
        would fill its space:
        <br />a broken heart is body's pain indeed.
        <br />
        Days pass, and nights, flowing into weeks;
        <br />
        milk no longer spills
        <br />
        with my tears.
        <br />
        Hours once spent weeping
        <br />
        now weave into patterns,
        <br />
        our words of grief and love
        <br />
        now reach for friendship's clasp,

        now look ahead...

      Pascale offers crisis counseling to expatriate staff of Relief
      International based in 16 countries over Skype when they experience a
      traumatic experience while in the field or suffer a personal crisis. She
      served as a psychologist to West African refugees on Samos Island, Greece,
      who had fled their home countries because of extreme violence and threats
      of death. She also trained local staff in Bangladesh who work with
      Rohingya refugees in Stress Management, Resilience and Self-Care, and met
      with them individually for counseling. She provided similar training and
      counseling to local staff in Juba and Maban, South Sudan, and in Nairobi
      Kenya. In addition, she was deployed to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake to
      provide grief counseling to civilians and hospital staff who had lost many
      family members and friends.
