          "The compassion, sympathy, and assurance she gave my husband and I
          helped us to move through the stages of our grief and realize that we
          were going to be ok. Her heartfelt questions and warm nature made it
          easy to open up and share our tragedy, our fears of trying again, our
          relationship struggles, our guilty thoughts, our happy moments, and so
          much more."
